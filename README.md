Simple Markdown Cheatsheet
==========================

A simple cheat sheet for writing Markdown.

> On the web, HTML is what your words are made of. How your words are interpreted depends upon the markup that accompanies them. As such, it’s important for people who care about the words to also care about the markup ... That said, HTML is designed to be readable by both humans and machines, and the latter requirement means it also tends towards the verbose. It’s a great tool for publishing, but a less-than-perfect one for authoring. That’s where Markdown comes in: recognizing that it’s important to author good HTML, Markdown proposes a shorthand to make authoring more comfortable.

## Text written in Markdown:

```
# Heading level one

## Heading level two

### Heading level three

#### Heading level four

This is a paragraph. It might have some *emphasised text* in it, or some **strongly emphasised text**.

> This text is a block quote. It could appear indented and italicised.

* This is a list item;
* another item; and
    * a tabbed-in sub item.


1. This is a numbered list item;
2. another item; and
    * a tabbed-in sub item.

[This is some linked text](http://example.com "This is the title text, available on hover.").
